## Background
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) play a crucial role in enhancing road safety and traffic management in India. Through the utilization of AI-based solutions, ITS is evolving rapidly to address road safety challenges. This readme file provides an overview of the various works and methodologies within this field. In an ideal scenario of perfect communication and coordination, where autonomous vehicles replace human-driven ones, the need for traditional traffic lights becomes obsolete.
